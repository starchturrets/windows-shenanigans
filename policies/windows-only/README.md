Policies for only windows, kept relatively minimal. Limits diagnostic data, spotlight, and bing nonsense as much as possible per edition. Also turns off copilot. Smartscreen is left up to the individual user to configure as it is threat model dependent.

- Disables required diagnostic data, or prevents sending device name with it if on pro
- Disables tailored experiences with diagnostics data (prolly redundant tho due to it being asked in the OOBE on OS install)
- Disables bing web search in the start menu
- Disables spotlight completely, or disables the desktop background slideshows only if on pro (lockscreen tips can be disabled manually from settings) 
- Disables annoying notifications if on enterprise (can be turned off manually from notifications settings if not)
- Disables recovery questions/OOBE so making a new user account is less annoying
- Disables Widgets
- Disables automatic sample submission in Windows Security
- Disables cloud optimized content (annoying pinned apps in start menu) for new user accounts
- Disables Windows Plug and Play auto installers (https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/how-to-block-windows-plug-and-play-auto-installing-insecure-apps/)
- Disables Windows Copilot
- Disables Online Tips in the settings app
- Disables file explorer requesting cloud metadata for insights (prolly redundant with a local account but I set it anyways)
